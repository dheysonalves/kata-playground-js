# Native Promise

Promises are just objects that contain the outcome of asynchronous operations. So when do you use one? When you want to control the outcome of an asynchronous operation.

Create a simple promise and pass the resolve function a string value of your choice. Use the setTimeout function as your asynchronous operation. Your setTimeout() function should not exceed 1000ms. Store the promise inside a variable named promise.
