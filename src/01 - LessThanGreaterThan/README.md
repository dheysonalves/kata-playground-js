# Less Than, Greater Than

Create a function that takes two numbers num1, num2, and an array arr and returns an array containing all the numbers in arr greater than num1 and less than num2.

Examples:

```javascript
arrBetween(3, 8, [1, 5, 95, 0, 4, 7]) ➞ [5, 4, 7]

arrBetween(1, 10, [1, 10, 25, 8, 11, 6]) ➞ [8, 6]

arrBetween(7, 32, [1, 2, 3, 78]) ➞ []
```
